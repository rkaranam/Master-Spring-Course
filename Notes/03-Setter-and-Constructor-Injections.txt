3 Ways of autowiring:

Constructor:
- Autowiring by type from bean name 'binarySearchImpl' via constructor to bean named 'quickSortAlgorithm'

Setter:
- Autowiring by type from bean name 'binarySearchImpl' to bean named 'quickSortAlgorithm'

No Setter or Constructor:
- Autowiring by type from bean name 'binarySearchImpl' to bean named 'quickSortAlgorithm'

1. How do we pass the parameter to the constructor in spring like Test t = new Test(1), a parameterized constructor?

You would need to use Constructor injection.

You need to create a Constructor accepting one parameter and have @Autowired on it.
